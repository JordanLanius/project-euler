# Jordan Lanius's Project Euler Collection

## About the Collection:

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my programming using the framework of Project Euler. This is a personal project that I have wanted to attempt for a while and I'm excited to finally get started.

## What is Project Euler?

According to ProjectEuler.net:

>Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
>
>The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

If you find Project Euler interesting, please attempt the problems for yourself before browsing my solutions. You would only cheat yourself of the learning and enjoyment found in the solving of these challenges.

## What Programming Language is Used?

In addition to showcasing programming skills, I also believe this project is a good way to practice each language I know so I don't grow rusty. To best do this, I use a randomization application to select from the following languages:

- C
- C++
- C#
- Java
- Python
- Visual Basic

Additional languages may be added in the future.
